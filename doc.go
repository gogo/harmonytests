//This package tests and provides a specification for how gogoprotobuf interacts with goprotobuf.
//Most tests have some comments above, like so:
//
//Optional Native
//Values are available
//Nullable is false
//GoGo -> GoGo
//
//"Optional Native" describes the type of struct begin tested.
//"Values are available" describes the values that have been set in the struct.
//"Nullable is false" implies that the struct was generated where all fields has a nullable extension value set to false.
//"GoGo -> Go" implies that a gogoprotobuf generated struct is being marshalled and unmarshalled by a goprotobuf generated struct.
//
//The variable names also has some shorthand, which describes some of the same things as the comments.
//nid = nil is default (nullable = false)
//nin = nil is nil (nullable = true) [typical]
//vis = value is set
//vim = value is missing
